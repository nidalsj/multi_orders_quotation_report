**Overview**

Automatic pagination for selections exceeding 4 orders
Minimalist design showing only product name and quantity
Uses Odoo's internal layout template
Compatible with bulk printing from sales order list view

**Usage**

Go to Sales > Orders > Quotations
Select multiple quotations from the list view
Click on the Print button and select "Quotation Report"
The system will generate a PDF with up to 4 quotations per page in a grid layout
